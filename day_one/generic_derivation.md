### Generic Derivation: The Hard Parts - Travis Brown

A talk by Travis Brown, creator of the Circe (SUR-see, like in GoT) JSON library amongst other things, on the 
difficulties of using generic programming to implement boilerplate-free marshalling/unmarshalling of JSON data.

The title of the talk sounded a bit intimidating for me, so I went to the CBT one instead.
