### A Whirlwind Tour of scala.meta - Olafur Pall Geirsson

A workshop on the metaprogramming framework used in macros to modify the AST of a program during compilation.
Blighted by lack of bandwidth on the conference WiFi (wireless fidelity? what on earth is that meant to mean?), 
which apparently prevented attendees from following along.

Clashed with Dave Gurnell's shapeless workshop, so unfortunately I had to skip this one.
