### Learn You (Advanced) Akka Streams for Great Good! - Heiko Seeberger

Heiko Seeberger walked us through a live coding demo of the akka streams API, implementing a client for the 'server
sent events' (SSE) push mechanism for HTTP. The code looked great but would have appreciated a bit more explanation of
'why' alongside the 'how', I guess that's the nature of live coding.
