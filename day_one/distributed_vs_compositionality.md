### Distributed Systems vs. Compositionality - Roland Kuhn

Impenetrable explanation of how the &#928; calculus (me neither) forms the theoretical underpinnings of an experimental new

Aleksandar Prokopec (a concurrent and distributed programming researcher, previously at EPFL and now Oracle) and 
Martin Odersky.
