# Scala World 2016 Conference Report

Last Monday a couple of hundred members of scala's functional programming community turned out at the Rheged
Centre in Penrith for two days of talks given by some of the most prominent experts in the language. The small-ish 
size of the event no doubt in part due to it's relative inaccessibility, in more than one sense of the word. A fact the 
organisers seem fairly proud of.

The stage was well set on the evening before the start of the conference when, on asking for three pints of a guest beer
called Yolo at a local bar, a helpful voice chirped up 'I think you'll find that's Yolii'. Found the right place at
least then.

The speaking line-up was a bit depleted due to several last minute drop-outs. This resulted in a bit of organisational
confusion as attendees were left without a schedule right up until the start of the conference on Monday morning. A
fact that organiser Jon Pretty (Propensive) was reminded of repeatedly. All of the talks that did end up happening
are listed in the table below.

Highlights for me included: [Raul Raja's talk](day_one/run_wild_run_free.md) on emerging FP patterns; Dave Gurnell's [intro to Shapeless](day_one/guide_to_shapeless.md); and the [live 
coding session on free monads](day_two/free_monads.md) presented by Pawel Szulc.
