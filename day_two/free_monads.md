### Make Your Programs Free - Pawel Szulc

Great last-minute live coding session on free monads, covering implementation of a simple algrebra, vertical and 
horizontal composition. Worth going through the history of the repo commit-by-commit to see how the final version is
built up, as Pawel did in the talk. Also to observe the content being put together at 2am on the day of the talk!

The intial example is taken directly from the book 'Functional Programming in Scala', published towards the end of 
2014. A book I still haven't managed to finish after four attempts.
