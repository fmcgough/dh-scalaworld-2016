### FOR, What is it good for? Absolute[T] Nothing - Dick Wall and Josh Suereth

Lots of things you can do with scala's 'for' syntax. Spent a long time on basics that very few people in
the room will have been unaware of and then flew threw some more interesting bits at the end.

Included a somewhat controversial recommendation to use 'for' in some situations where a simple monad transformer
might be found. Something to do with dependencies and the rule of least power. Audience didn't seem to approve.

One noteworthy point is the mention of Josh's automatic resource management project 
(https://github.com/jsuereth/scala-arm), looks useful and something I've not come across previously. Unfortunately
this seems to have been superseded later in the day by an approach put forward in Denys Shabalin's talk.
