### Can We Make Concurrency in Scala Safer? - Phillip Haller

Missed this one, and I can't find any links for it online. Here's the abstract though:

> Concurrent programming is infamous for its difficulty. Hazards like
> race conditions manifest themselves as bugs that are often hard to
> find and fix. This talk presents LaCasa, a minimal Scala extension
> designed to express concepts such as isolation and access permissions
> via types. Among others, LaCasa's refinement of Scala's type system
> enables enforcing the isolation of actors, at compile time. Building
> on the object capability model, LaCasa also provides strong security
> properties, enabling applications beyond safe concurrency.
